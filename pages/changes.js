              I have been hearing a lot lately, that the rise in COVID-19 cases
              in the UK can be attributed to the rise in testing numbers. I
              hadn't really seen any data supporting this theory so thought I
              would attempt to find an answer to that statement.

              This chart aims to show the change in the new number of COVID-19
              cases in the UK, compared to the change in the new number of tests
              completed in a 24 hour period.

              This is done by showing what percentage have these figures changed
              compared to the day before. The green line shows the cases, and
              the blue shows the tests. It also shows the average for the last 7
              days in the cases and tests, the Red and Yellow lines.

              If the lines follow each other and are close together, then the
              change in numbers can be seen to reflect each other, so a 10%
              increase in tests causes a 10% increase in new cases.

            <Text padding="0.4rem" color="dimgray">
              If there are significantly higher spikes on the green line
              compared to the blue line. This indicates that there has been an
              increase in cases that is not directly related to a change in
              testing numbers. The same is true for the opposite, spikes on the
              blue line would indicate that more testing has been done, but has
              not drastically increased the number of cases.

              If this chart is showing all the lines close together, then case
              numbers and test numbers will be following a similar trend, and it
              is likely any change in case number is due in part to the change
              in testing figures. Seeing a higher percentage of cases compared
              to tests is a worry, so if the green and red lines are constantly
              higher than the blue and yellow lines, then this is a cause for
              concern. Ideally if the UK is doing well against the spread of the
              COVID virus, we would see the Blue and Yellow lines higher then
              the 0 percentile line, and the Red and Green line consistently
              below the 0 percentile line

              This data needs to be taken in consideration with other factors.
              For example, a 100% increase in cases could indicate a big jump,
              but if that is from 1 case to 2 cases, this is obviously not a big
              jump. So this chart alone does not provide a complete picture.
