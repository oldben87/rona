            Herd Immunity is the idea that a virus cannot spread to the rest of
            the population easily, if the majority of the population has been
            vaccinated against the virus. Or if there is a natural immunity
            through people contracting the virus and building up anti-bodies
            through infection.

              Figures vary from as low as 25% to as high as 90%, with the higher
              number of 90% saved for viruses that are more contagious. And the
              lower figures for viruses that aren't as contagious. A general
              concensus has averaged at around 60% of our population would need
              to be immune, whether that be through a vaccine or by enough
              people contracting the virus through exposure.

              There is evidence to suggest that 10% of mild cases of Covid, end
              up developing long term debilitating symptoms of the virus. To
              find this number of people, we can take the cases of covid{' '}
              {lastDay.cumCasesByPublishDate.toLocaleString()}, and remove the
              number of people who have been admitted to hospital{' '}
              {hospCases.toLocaleString()}. This gives us{' '}
              {mildCases.toLocaleString()} mild cases. Which would indicate that{' '}
              {Math.floor(mildCases / 10).toLocaleString()} people will be
              suffering from Long Covid. We can calculate that this is{' '}
